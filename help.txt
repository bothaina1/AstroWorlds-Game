WELCOME TO ASTROWORLDS!

Here is how to play our game :
Use the keys up, down, left, and right to move the astronaut.
In order to get points, you need to collect three identical shapes in the stack.
Stay away from aliens and don't make your stack reach the spaceships
so you can keep your battery charged.
To recharge your battery, collect hearts.
If you want to undo a move, collect undoes, and click on them.

HAVE A NICE GAME!
